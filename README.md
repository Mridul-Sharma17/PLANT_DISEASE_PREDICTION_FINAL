# Plant Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project uses CNN-based deep learning models to predict plant diseases from images. Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop health and yield.

## Features
- Image-based disease detection
- Multiple CNN architectures
- High accuracy prediction
- User-friendly interface

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-prediction.git
cd plant-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/plant/image.jpg
```

## Dataset
The models are trained on the [PlantVillage dataset](hhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) containing thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

## Trained Model
The trained model files can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKh-IElSdHTqax7XdfSdZTn-r8T_qWPf/view).
